# Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Tension-Aware Motion Planning** project, which is a companion code to the paper:

**Tension-aware Motion Planning for Tethered Robots**

Authors: Rog√©rio R. Lima and Guilherme A. S. Pereira

You can find the repository at the following Bitbucket link:
[wvufarolab/tension-aware-motion-planning](https://bitbucket.org/wvufarolab/tension-aware-motion-planning/src/main/)

The paper presents a novel path planning approach for tethered robots with minimization of cable tension. The accompanying code provides the implementation and experimentation details discussed in the paper.

## How to Run the Code

To execute the code, you need to run the `main.m` file.

### Steps to Run:
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the folder where the project files are located.
3. Run the following command in the MATLAB command window:
   ```
   main
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure all necessary dependencies and required files are in the same directory as `main.m`.
- MATLAB version **R2022a** or later is recommended for optimal performance.
